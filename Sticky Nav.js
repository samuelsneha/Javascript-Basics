//I have put nav element before clasList but the css effects need not be only on the nav element. You can go deep inside the hierarchy of the nav element also and create adjustments on child elements of nav also when you add a class
//element.offsetHeight returns the height of an element, including vertical padding and borders, scrollbars as an integer in pixels. It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after
//scrollY/X - (based on window) The read-only scrollY property of the Window interface returns the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically. Whereas, scrollTop/Left - (based on element) The scrollLeft and scrollTop properties return the number of pixels that the elementâ€™s content is scrolled from its left and top edges. ScrollTop is basically can be get and set, where as scrollY of window's only can be get.
//getBoundingClientRect() also needs to be explored
